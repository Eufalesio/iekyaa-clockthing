A succint clock that is synchronous with Unix time, that would represent the exact time and date in Iekyā, time specifically in the East of Masīrika. This clock takes the current unix epoch, and adds the amount of seconds that have passed since the start of Unix to 23rd of March, 1250, 00:00:00 UTC+0. The rest of the values and parameters are just ways of displaying the big number.
